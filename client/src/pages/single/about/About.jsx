                <p className="text">Software developer with a master's degree in Computer Science. Analytical and performance-focused professional offering a hands-on experience in JavaScript and React framework with background in the information technology industry, known for expertise in programming, software engineering, and project management.
                 What I like about the software development process is that questions and deconstruction of concepts are not only encouraged, but are what separate the good from the best. I enjoy thinking about why React hooks are better than React classes or learning about why object-oriented programming is more popular in back end applications. Being a lifetime student of computer science and software development in inevitable. Each day will provide new challenges and lessons. I cannot think of a more fulfilling career path in that regard.

                My strengths include the ability to quickly pick up new skills and intuit concepts. I enjoy the human connection and working together with others. If you are looking for a software engineer with soft skills and the ability to work with multiple types of personalities (especially in high pressure situations), I am your guy!
                As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I focus on React, Node, RESTful Architecture and Web Accessibility in Agile settings üòÅ
